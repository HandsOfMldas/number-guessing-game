Number Guessing Game

This is a simple console-based number guessing game implemented in C#. The game prompts the user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 99. The player has up to five attempts to guess the correct number, receiving hints to guess higher or lower with each attempt. If the player guesses correctly within the allowed attempts, they win; otherwise, the correct number is revealed.
